Albert Wang (adwwang@me.com)

This repository contains Course Project 1 for the Exploratory Data Analysis subject on Coursera.

Files included:
* plot1-4.R: R scripts to produce plots based on the following data: https://d396qusza40orc.cloudfront.net/exdata%2Fdata%2Fhousehold_power_consumption.zip
* plot1-4.png: output PNG files of the plots created by each R script respectively.

### Notes:
The "dplyr" package must be installed for the scripts to work.
The scripts require "household_power_consumption.txt" (the unzipped file from the link above) to be located in the current R working directory.
